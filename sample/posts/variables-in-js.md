# Variables
Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. Here are two examples:

An online shop – the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.
A chat application – the information might include users, messages, and much more.
Variables are used to store this information.

### A variable
A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.

The statement below creates (in other words: declares or defines) a variable with the name “message”:

```js
const username = "Arya Stark";
let houseName = "Stark";
```
